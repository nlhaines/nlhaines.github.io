                <h3>Personal Finance Package for R</h3>
                <p>A package for simulating personal finance outcomes. Simulations are month-by-month and account for changes in macro-economic factors such as inflation, interest rates, and more. You define your investments, income streams, monthly spending, how much you'd like to invest in the stock market monthly, and how you'd like to allocate your cash between currencies. Users can define targets for key metrics to see how long they will take to reach under different scenarios, or see where those metrics will be at the end of the simulation period. Development is ongoing and suggestions are welcome.</p>

                <h3>Financial Simulations and Projections</h3>
                <p>The world is complex, and everything is interconnected. If you're considering an investment with a lot of moving parts, negotiating a deal, or just trying to plan your financial future, my financial simulations can help. Instead of assuming steady growth rates, and set valuation multiples my simulations can account for correlations in asset values, random events, changes in interest rates, inflation, and black-swan catastrophes, helping you understand what key metrics look like under median, ideal, and worst-case-scenarios.</p>

                <h3>Streamlined Business Valuations</h3>
                <p>At Sax Capital Partners, I worked extensively with numerous small businesses, guiding them through the process of selling their enterprises. I understand the unique challenges small business owners face, and their need for straightforward, jargon-free communication and efficient use of time.</p>
                <p>To address these needs, I developed a streamlined valuation report specifically designed for small business owners. This report provides clear and concise insights into the value of their business, along with key insights into what can be done to enhance that value.</p>
                <p>These streamlined business valuations start at just $500, making it a cost-effective alternative to traditional valuation methods that typically cost $3000 or more. Whether you plan to sell soon or not, as a small business owner knowledge of your business's value is key to making informed decisions and optimizing your financial future.</p>

                <h3>Short Term Rental Report</h3>
                <p>As an experienced Airbnb host and data analyst I'll leverage data from leading providers in short-term rental data to help you project what you can make with a short-term rental acquisition. For years short-term rentals have been a great way to boost your returns on rental properties, but many markets are softening and changes in regulations can quickly change the outlook. Whether you're deciding between a few prospective properties, weighing the idea in general, or attempting to value a property, I can help.</p>
